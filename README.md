# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use Sequel to create tables in order to visualize how many employees are likely to retire soon, and from which departments. This analysis also looked at employees to potentially put in mentorship postions to fill those positions in the future.
## Results
. There are currently more employees who are soon to retire than those who are eligible for a mentorship
. The vast majority of the employees who are soon to retire work as either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff
. The Department Manager positions should be easy to fill, as only two of them are currently held by someone nearing retirement age
. These results mean that the company should probably start hiring now in order to avoid falling behind when those employees do retire
## Summary
To conclude, most workers than are likely to retire in the near future work as Senior Engineers or Senior Staff, and there are not enough employees already within the company that qualify for the mentorship to fill the void. Therefore, I recommend expanding the mentorship qualifications to anyone who has been in the company for a decade or more. Another idea for future analysis would be to test pay raises to see if they improve employee retention, so the Pewlett-Hackard does not lose additional employees to other companies.
